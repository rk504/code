Dasher Selection Process for Widget Deliveries

Since widget deliveries require higher precision and reliability, we should select Dashers based on key performance indicators. Given the differences between Dashattan (dense urban) and Doorlanta (sprawling suburban), we will adjust criteria accordingly.
1. Selection Criteria for Dashers

    General Requirements (Both Cities)
        Minimum composite star rating of 4.5+ (higher-rated Dashers are more reliable).
        Minimum of 500+ lifetime deliveries (ensures experience).
        Above-median on-time delivery percentage.

    MARKET_NAME-Specific Adjustments
        Dashattan (Urban)
            Prioritize bikers and motorbikes over cars for faster navigation in traffic.
            Focus on Dashers with high short-distance delivery efficiency.
        Doorlanta (Suburban)
            Prioritize Dashers with cars due to longer distances.
            Consider experience in handling long-distance deliveries efficiently. """

# Question 2)

# 2. Distributing Widget Satchels to Dashers
""" 
In Dashattan: Implement centralized pickup locations strategically placed near high-demand zones to maximize efficiency. Dashers should collect satchels at the beginning of their shifts to ensure they are ready for widget deliveries.
In Doorlanta: Due to the cityâ€™s sprawling nature, distribute satchels directly to the homes of the select group of full-time Dashers specializing in widget deliveries. If mailing satchels is cost-prohibitive due to their value or size, consider leveraging regional distribution hubs to manage logistics more effectively.

# 3. Measuring Program Success
""" 
    Delivery Quality
        On-time delivery rate (percentage of widget orders delivered within quoted time).
